## Supported Versions

The following versions of InnoVault are actively supported with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |

Older versions are not supported and users are encouraged to always use the latest version of the API for maximum security and functionality.

## Please note:
- Developers are free to use and modify InnoVault’s source code but **must not embed the source code directly** into their mods, as it violates the open-source policy.
- While embedding the compiled InnoVault DLL is allowed, it is not recommended. If you choose this route, please credit InnoVault in your mod's description.
